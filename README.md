# CIIC5015-Project-3
Convolutional Neural Networks for classification using the MNIST dataset. In this project, I developed four convolutional neural networks in order to train and test against the MNIST dataset. These four networks are developed using a combination of the following layers: convolutional, fully connected, ReLU, flatten, batch normalization, max pooling, and dropout.
